# 🔧 Production-focused Infrastructure Engineer

> **"I don't panic when error messages appear. I only worry when systems fail silently."**

I specialize in building lean, reliable systems that survive real-world traffic — and more importantly, I know how to fix them when they break. My approach: understand the system from hardware up, trace every error to its root cause, and optimize for actual performance metrics, not synthetic benchmarks.

## 🎯 What I Do Best

- **🚀 Build & Scale Production Systems**: Design architectures that handle 57K+ weekly pageviews on minimal resources
- **⚡ Performance Engineering**: Achieve 99.93% cache hit rates and sub-200ms response times under heavy load
- **☁️ Cost Optimization**: Expert at maximizing performance while minimizing infrastructure costs
- **🔧 Complex Troubleshooting**: Deep-dive into logs and system bottlenecks when others give up
- **🤖 Infrastructure Automation**: Craft deployment scripts and monitoring solutions

## 🏆 Production Case Studies

| Project | Real-World Impact | Performance |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **[5K Users on 1GB VPS](https://github.com/aleixnguyen-vn/docker-wordpress-performance)** | 5,000 concurrent users on $6/month VPS | 187ms avg response, 99.93% cache hit rate, 0% errors |
| **[AWS Free Tier at Scale](https://github.com/aleixnguyen-vn/litespeed-redis-wordpress-on-aws)** | 57K weekly pageviews on t2.micro | 798MB RAM peak, 99.91% Redis hit rate, zero downtime |
| **[Hugo → WordPress Migration](https://github.com/aleixnguyen-vn/hugo-to-wordpress-migration)** | 900+ posts migrated with custom features | Built from zero PHP knowledge to production-ready |

## 🧠 My Approach

**"No shortcuts. Just logic and logs."**

I don't rely on panels or one-click solutions. Every configuration is hand-written because understanding system architecture is crucial when things break at 3 AM.

**AI-Assisted Modern Approach**: Leverage AI-assisted workflows for rapid development while maintaining architectural control. Focus on system design and problem-solving over language-specific implementation.

### Problem-Solving Methodology:
1. **Read the actual error message** (90% of people skip this)
2. **Trace from symptom to root cause** using extensive log analysis
3. **Fix the source, not the symptom** to prevent recurring issues
4. **Document and benchmark** for continuous improvement

### Results:
- ⚡ Faster incident response and higher uptime
- 🔒 More reliable, long-term solutions
- 💰 Superior resource utilization and cost efficiency
- 🎯 Systems that adapt and scale with real-world demands
