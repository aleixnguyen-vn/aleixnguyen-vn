# 🔧 Production-focused Infrastructure Engineer

> **"I don't panic when error messages appear. I only worry when systems fail silently."**

I specialize in building lean, reliable systems that survive real-world traffic — and more importantly, I know how to fix them when they break. My approach: understand the system from hardware up, trace every error to its root cause, and optimize for actual performance metrics, not synthetic benchmarks.

## 🎯 What I Do Best

- **🚀 Build & Fortify Production Systems**: Design server architectures that handle 57K+ weekly pageviews on AWS Free Tier
- **🤖 Automate Everything**: Craft robust deployment scripts and infrastructure tooling
- **☁️ Cloud Resource Optimization**: Expert at squeezing maximum performance while minimizing costs across AWS, Vultr, Azure
- **📊 Performance Engineering**: Benchmark live traffic, eliminate bottlenecks, achieve 99.91% Redis hit rates
- **💡 Master Complex Troubleshooting**: Deep-dive into logs and undocumented issues when others give up
- **🔌 Hardware-Level Expertise**: From component optimization to thermal management

## 🧠 My Philosophy

**"No shortcuts. Just logic and logs."**

I don't rely on panels or one-click solutions. Every configuration is written by hand because understanding the system architecture is crucial when things go wrong at 3 AM.

### My Problem-Solving Approach:
1. **Read the actual error message** (90% of people skip this)
2. **Trace from symptom to root cause** using extensive log analysis
3. **Fix the source, not the symptom** to prevent recurring issues
4. **Document everything** for future reference and continuous learning

### Why This Matters:
- ⚡ Faster incident response and higher uptime
- 🔒 More reliable, long-term solutions
- 💰 Superior resource utilization and cost efficiency
- 🎯 Confidence to adapt complex systems as needs evolve

## 🎮 Beyond Code: High-Performance Mindset

**Virtual Endurance Racing**: I compete in 6-24 hour championships (BMW M Hybrid V8, Porsche 963 on iRacing, LMU), which directly translates to infrastructure reliability:
- Strategic resource management under sustained load
- Real-time performance optimization when every second counts
- Team coordination during critical deployments
- Maintaining focus during extended troubleshooting sessions

**Advanced Flight Simulation**: Manual approaches on B777-300ER, B747-400F, A330/A340 in challenging conditions, requiring:
- Real-time multi-system monitoring
- Precision control under high-stress scenarios
- Quick adaptation between different platforms
- Critical decision-making during adverse conditions

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **Auto-Install Script for LiteSpeed**: 1-command deployment in <5 minutes
- **Production Incident Response Methodology**: Systematic debugging approach documented through real scenarios
- **Hardware-Optimized VPS Configuration**: Memory and I/O optimization for resource-constrained environments
